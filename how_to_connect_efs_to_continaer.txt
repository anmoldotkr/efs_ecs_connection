To connect your EFS file system to a running container (or when a new container is launched), you need to follow these steps:

1. **Create IAM Permissions for EFS**:
   - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to allow Amazon ECS tasks to access the EFS file system.

2. **Create a New Task Definition**:
   - Update the task definition to mount the EFS file system to the container.

3. **Update the ECS Service**:
   - Update the ECS service to use the new task definition.

Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

---

### **Step 1: Create IAM Permissions for EFS**

Create an IAM role that allows your ECS tasks to access the EFS file system.

#### IAM Role Policy Example:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount",
        "elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite",
        "elasticfilesystem:ClientRootAccess"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:region:account-id:file-system/file-system-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **IAM Console**.
2. Create a new role for ECS tasks.
3. Attach the above policy to the role.
4. Note the role ARN for use in the task definition.

### **Step 2: Create a New Task Definition**

Update your ECS task definition to mount the EFS file system.

#### Task Definition Example:
```json
{
  "family": "my-task-definition",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "my-container",
      "image": "my-container-image",
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256,
      "essential": true,
      "mountPoints": [
        {
          "sourceVolume": "efs-volume",
          "containerPath": "/mnt/efs"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "volumes": [
    {
      "name": "efs-volume",
      "efsVolumeConfiguration": {
        "fileSystemId": "fs-xxxxxxxx",
        "rootDirectory": "/my-specific-directory",
        "transitEncryption": "ENABLED",
        "authorizationConfig": {
          "accessPointId": "fsap-xxxxxxxx",
          "iam": "ENABLED"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **ECS Console**.
2. Select **Task Definitions** and create a new revision of your task definition.
3. Under the **Volumes** section, add a new volume:
   - Name: `efs-volume`
   - Volume Type: **EFS**
   - File System ID: Enter your EFS file system ID.
   - Root Directory: Enter `/my-specific-directory` (or your desired path).
   - Access Point ID: Enter your EFS access point ID.
   - Enable IAM authorization.
4. Under the **Container Definitions** section, add a mount point:
   - Source Volume: `efs-volume`
   - Container Path: `/mnt/efs` (or your desired path inside the container).
5. Save the task definition.

---

### **Step 3: Update the ECS Service**

Update your ECS service to use the new task definition.

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **ECS Console**.
2. Select the cluster and service you want to update.
3. Click **Update Service**.
4. Under **Task Definition**, select the new revision of the task definition you created.
5. Click **Next** and complete the update process.

---

### **Summary of Steps**
1. **IAM Role**: Create an IAM role with permissions to access EFS.
2. **Task Definition**: Update the task definition to mount the EFS file system.
3. **ECS Service**: Update the ECS service to use the new task definition.

This will ensure that your running containers (or new containers) can access the EFS file system with the appropriate directory structure and permissions.
